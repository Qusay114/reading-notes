# Version Control System

The programmers always try to improve their codes and add codes ,  which the need to update the version of their codes always
and in the same time they don't want to lose their old versions of the codes which make that hard to do it manually ,
 so Github has something called Version Control System to allow the programmer to update their codes as much as they want without losing any version of their work and it allows them to share their with other people .
they can make their work local or cloud , when their work is local they can update their work on github using these commands :

__git add *.c__<br>
__git add LICENSE__<br>
__git commit -m “any message here”__
