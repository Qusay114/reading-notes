# Images :

In order to make our pages looks more attractive we put in it images and we can include images in our page using 
image tag .

Example :
	
	'''<img alt="here the text that will show in case the image failed to upload" src="ImagePath or ImageLink"  /> 



there are a lot of tools to design our images and edit them such as Adobe Photoshop .


* Image format :

	* Whenever you have many different
	colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.
	A photograph that features snow or an
	overcast sky might look like it has large
	areas that are just white or gray, but the
	picture is usually made up of many different
	colors that are subtly different.

	* Use GIF or PNG format
	when saving images
	with few colors or large
	areas of the same color.



# Colors:

One of the best things in designing the pages is the you have a full control of the colors that will be shown in the page 
and the colors can make your page even more attracive for the user .

We can assign a specific color using four main ways:

	*Color name : by using color name only such as black.

	*RGB(0-255,0-255,0-255) : by using rgb code such as rgb(255,0,0) this will be red .

	* #hexCode : by using Hex code such as #AACCFF

	* hsl(0-400,0-100%,0-100%)



* Color properties :

	* color property : this will change the color of the text .

	* background-color property : as its name indicate , this will change the background color.




# Text :

There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing , and There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed . If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
