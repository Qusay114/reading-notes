### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

And these pc’s were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative.

Movies with plots that promotes the story of that awkward geek boy genius who uses tech savvy to triumph over adversity and win the girl.


### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.

example: When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.

### What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

* More than %50 of US are interested in technology
* Males are using the internet more than females.

### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
Because when they grow up they would already know alot of things that would help them to stand out.

Employee breakdown of key technology companies What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data? females emplyment precentage are way less than males. precentage of females in other ethnicities than white are way less than precentage for white females. year-by-year the precentage of females are getting higher.
