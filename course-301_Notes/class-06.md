We can simply define Node.js as "a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine." according to the official website , in other words we can use Node to execute our javascripts programs without using the browser .Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is simply JavaScript engine in Google chroome and other chromium-based web browsers to compile our javascript runtime(where javaScript code is excuted , e.g:on V8) codes.

### npm :
Stands for node package manager , It's a very poweful tool to handle our installing packages , which has 1,000,000 globally packages , and we can install any package using the terminal in one command , e.g: 
<br> npm install -g jshint <br>
, this will install jshint package globally on my system .The version of node I use in my machine is v12.21.0 while the npm is 7.11.2

It's a way where two developers work on a coding task together , where someone will guide what the codes should do , how it will look like and think in the bigger picture of the code this one called Navigator , while the other one will handle writing the codes and it's call the Driver .
