# How the Web Works

When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
When you connect to the web,
you do so via an Internet Service
Provider (ISP). You type a
domain name or web address
into your browser to visit a site;
for example: google.com,
bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.
Your computer contacts a
network of servers called
Domain Name System (DNS)
servers. These act like phone
books; they tell your computer
the IP address associated with
the requested domain name.
An IP address is a number
of up to 12 digits separated
by periods / full stops. Every
device connected to the web
has a unique IP address; it is
like the phone number for that
computer.
The unique number that the
DNS server returns to your
computer allows your browser
to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested. A web server is a
computer that is constantly
connected to the web, and is set
up especially to send web pages
to users.


# The Structure of The Web Page:

To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.
Example(here the code is between the tags <> and the rest is the content )   

	<html>
		<body>
			<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
			<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
			the page. And if the page is a long one it might
			be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
			<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
			<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
			you follow the structure of what is being written.
			There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
			headings).</p>
			<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
			<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
		</body>
	</html>


HTML uses the elements to describe the structure of the pages.
here is the main elements:
	
	<html>
		<head>
		</head>

		<body>
		</body>
	</html>


# HTML versions:

As we know there is a different versions of HTML and they are HTML5, HTML4, Transitional XHTML 1.0, Strict XHTML 1.0 and XML Declaration and every version has a different way to indicate it , Examples:

* HTML5
* HTML4
* XML Declaration

# HTML elements:

There is Global attributes which are attributes that can be used on any element , including the class and id attributes. An example on how to embed a page within a page using iframes :

	<iframe width="450" height="350" src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york &output=embed"> </iframe>
	
An example on How to add information about the web page using the element :

	<title>Information About Your Pages</title>

# HTML Layout:

Html layout is the way of how your web page will look like , web developer usually create a wireframe to help them to design their web pages before starting to code . wireframe usually contains the header , main and the footer .the developers divide their codes using elements which make it easier to code and remember Some examples on these elements :

* Navigation and its tag
* Articles and its tag
* Asides and its tag
* Sections and its tag
* Heading Groups and its tag

# Process and Design:

* It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

# Script :

As for people to be able to do a new skill they learned they will need a series of instructions to guide them to do task, and in order to make the computer do a specific task we write something called the script which is a series of instructions . we can write a script by breaking the task into smaller steps: 
1: DEFINE THE GOAL : before we start to write the script we need to define the task we want to acheive . 
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT: we split the main task into a series of smaller tasks and we can represent that by using a flowchart,then we can write the necessary setps for each individual task 
3: CODE EACH STEP : after we wrote the steps , now we need to write them in a way that the computer understands, and we can do that by using a programming language(in our case, it will be JavaScript)
