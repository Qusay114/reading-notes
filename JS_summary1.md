# Modify Html content usign JS
In order to make our web pages more interactive , 
we use JavaScript language it allows us to access and modify the markup codes we used in the web page and that access and modifying it happens in according the actions that the user did in the browser 
such as clicking on a button , filling text boxes or hovers on a link . When an action happens we can access a specific elements by using the id attribute and modify our codes such as adding a paragraph of text after a specific element , change the value of class attributes to tigger new CSS rules for those elements 
or change the size or position of an <img> element . 

In order to modify a part of content we can reload part of the page which it can make the site fell like it is faster to 
load and more like an application , and we can do that by :
* **React**   :Script triggered when user clicks on link
* **Access**  :The link that they clicked on
* **Program** :load the new content that was requested from that link 
* **Access**  :find the element to replace in the page
* **Modify**  :Replace that content with the new content .                                                                                                        

# Script
As for people to be able to do a new skill they learned they will need a series of instructions to guide them to do task,
and in order to make the computer do a specific task we write something called the script which is a series of instructions .
we can write a script by breaking the task into smaller steps:
**1: DEFINE THE GOAL**  : before we start to write the script we need to define the task we want to acheive .
**2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT**: we split the main task into a series of smaller tasks and we can represent that by using a flowchart,then we can write the necessary setps for each individual task
**3: CODE EACH STEP**   : after we wrote the steps , now we need to write them in a way that the computer understands, and we can do that by using a programming language(in our case, it will be JavaScript)


# Syntax of the JavaScript language:
To write a variable it has to start with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number . you can't use a dash(#) or a dot (.) in the variable name .You cannot use keywords or reserved words in the variable name .
All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names.
There is many data types of the variable such as strings and arrays.
Array variables store a list of values , code example :

colors ['white', 'black', ' custom '];
var el document.getElementByld('col ors');
el . textContent = col ors[O];

each value inside the array has an index ,so we can access it and change it .
